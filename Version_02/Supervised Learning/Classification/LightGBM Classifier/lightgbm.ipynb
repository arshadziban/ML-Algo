    "## LightGBM Classifier: Simple Formal Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "**LightGBM** (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression problems. It is known for being fast and accurate, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Histogram-based Tree Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of checking every possible value of a feature, LightGBM first **groups the values into bins** (like dividing them into ranges).\n",
    "* This process is similar to making a histogram in statistics.\n",
    "* By using bins, LightGBM can find the best splits much faster, which saves time and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Leaf-wise Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "* When building a decision tree, most algorithms split the tree level by level.\n",
    "* LightGBM, however, **splits the leaf node that will reduce the prediction error the most** (called “leaf-wise” growth).\n",
    "* This means it focuses on the parts of the tree where the model is making the most mistakes, leading to better accuracy.\n",

    "| Index | Height (cm) | Weight (kg) | Class (Y) |\n",

    "| 1     | 150         | 45          | 0 (Short) |\n",

    "### Step 1: Histogram-based Binning\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM applies histogram-based binning to discretize continuous features into a fixed number of bins. For this example, assume two bins per feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Height:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Bin 1: 150–165 (containing values 150, 160)\n",
