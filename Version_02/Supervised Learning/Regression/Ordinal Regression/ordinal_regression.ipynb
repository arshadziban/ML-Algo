    "**Ordinal regression** is a statistical technique used to predict an outcome that can be sorted in a natural order, such as “low,” “medium,” and “high.” The method is helpful when the results are categories that have a clear ranking, but the exact distance between each category is not known. For example, ordinal regression can predict if someone’s satisfaction is “dissatisfied,” “neutral,” or “satisfied” based on other information.\n"
