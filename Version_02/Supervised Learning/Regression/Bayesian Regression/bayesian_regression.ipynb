    "\n",
    "Bayesian Regression is a way to make predictions by starting with a guess (called a **prior**), then looking at real data, and updating that guess to make a better one (called a **posterior**).\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses **Bayes’ Theorem**, a rule that helps combine your old belief and new evidence to get a smarter answer.\n",
