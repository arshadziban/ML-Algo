    "## What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decision tree** is a method used in machine learning to make predictions.\n",
    "It works like a **series of yes/no questions** that split the data into smaller and smaller groups, until you reach an answer (a prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **regression**, the answer is a **number** (like a price, temperature, or score).\n",
    "* For **classification**, the answer is a **category** (like \"yes/no\", \"apple/orange\").\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s called a “tree” because the splits and branches look like an upside-down tree!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Use Decision Trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Easy to Understand**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The “if this, then that” logic is simple and visual—humans can read and follow it.\n",
    "2. **Works for Numbers and Categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Can handle both regression (numbers) and classification (labels).\n",
    "3. **No Need for Complex Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Handles missing data and different types of features well.\n",
    "4. **Flexible and Powerful**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Can model complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A decision tree splits your data using simple questions until it’s easy to make a prediction.**\n",
    "* **We use it because it’s simple, clear, and works for many different types of problems.**\n",
