    "\n",
    "**Type:** Semi-Supervised Learning Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Co-training is a semi-supervised learning method where **two (or more) models**, each trained on **different, independent “views” of the same data**, iteratively label unlabeled examples for each other.\n",
    "A “view” means a distinct subset of features that can independently predict the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like two friends studying for an exam: each has different notes (views) on the same topics. They solve problems separately, then swap their confident answers so both can learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split Features into Two Views** — Example: webpage classification using *page content* vs *link text*.\n",
    "2. **Train Two Independent Models** — Each model learns from its own view using the labeled data.\n",
    "3. **Label Unlabeled Data** — Each model predicts labels for the unlabeled set.\n",
    "4. **Exchange Confident Labels** — Model A gives its confident predictions to Model B, and vice versa.\n",
    "5. **Retrain Models** — Both models train again with the newly labeled data from their partner.\n",
    "6. **Repeat** until no improvement or no confident new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses complementary information from different views.\n",
    "* Can achieve strong performance with very few initial labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires truly independent and sufficient views (not always possible).\n",
    "* Wrong confident labels can mislead the partner model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Webpage classification:** One model uses page text, another uses anchor text from inbound links.\n",
    "* **Video analysis:** One model uses visual features, another uses audio features.\n",
    "* **Medical data:** One model uses lab test results, another uses imaging data."
