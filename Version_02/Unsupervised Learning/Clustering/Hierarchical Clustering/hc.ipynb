    "### What is Hierarchical Clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a way to group similar things (data points) step-by-step, making a tree of groups (clusters). You don’t need to say how many groups you want beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works (Agglomerative Way):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with every item in its own group.\n",
    "2. Find the two closest groups and combine them.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 until all items are in one big group or until you want to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Dendrogram?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **dendrogram** looks like a tree diagram.\n",
    "* It shows which groups got combined at each step.\n",
    "* You can \"cut\" this tree at any height to decide how many groups you want.\n",
    "\n",

    "### How to Measure Distance Between Groups? (Linkage)\n",
    "\n",
    "When merging groups, you need to know how close they are. There are different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single linkage:** Distance between two groups = the smallest distance between any two points in those groups.\n",
    "  *Think: just one close pair is enough to join them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complete linkage:** Distance = the largest distance between any two points in the groups.\n",
    "  *Think: groups only join if all points are close.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average linkage:** Distance = the average distance between all pairs of points in the groups.\n",
    "  *Think: average closeness matters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ward’s linkage:** Join groups so the overall difference inside groups stays as small as possible.\n",
    "  *Think: keeps groups tight and balanced.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have 4 points: A, B, C, D.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A and B are close, so you join them first.\n",
    "* Then C and D are close, so you join them.\n",
    "* Finally, you join the two groups {A,B} and {C,D}.\n"
