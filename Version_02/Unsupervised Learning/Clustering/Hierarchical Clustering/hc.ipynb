    "### What is Hierarchical Clustering?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### How It Works (Agglomerative Way):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with every item in its own group.\n",
    "2. Find the two closest groups and combine them.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 until all items are in one big group or until you want to stop.\n",

    "### What is a Dendrogram?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **dendrogram** looks like a tree diagram.\n",
    "* It shows which groups got combined at each step.\n",
    "* You can \"cut\" this tree at any height to decide how many groups you want.\n",

    "\n",
    "When merging groups, you need to know how close they are. There are different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single linkage:** Distance between two groups = the smallest distance between any two points in those groups.\n",
    "  *Think: just one close pair is enough to join them.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Complete linkage:** Distance = the largest distance between any two points in the groups.\n",
    "  *Think: groups only join if all points are close.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average linkage:** Distance = the average distance between all pairs of points in the groups.\n",
    "  *Think: average closeness matters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ward’s linkage:** Join groups so the overall difference inside groups stays as small as possible.\n",
    "  *Think: keeps groups tight and balanced.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have 4 points: A, B, C, D.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A and B are close, so you join them first.\n",
    "* Then C and D are close, so you join them.\n",
    "* Finally, you join the two groups {A,B} and {C,D}.\n"
