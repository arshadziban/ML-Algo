    "### Mean Shift Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Shift is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that **finds clusters by locating the dense areas (modes) in the data**. It does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Mode Seeking\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **mode** is a peak or highest point in a density distribution — basically, a point where data is densest.\n",
    "* Mean Shift works by iteratively moving data points toward the nearest mode (peak) of the data distribution.\n",
    "* Points that converge to the same mode belong to the same cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "* KDE is a way to estimate the data’s probability density function (how data is distributed) without assuming a specific distribution shape.\n",
    "* It uses a **kernel** (a smooth weighting function, e.g., Gaussian) to weigh nearby points, producing a smooth density estimate.\n",
    "* In Mean Shift, KDE helps identify where the density peaks (modes) are.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Mean Shift Clustering Works (Step-by-step)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: Start with a set of points in the data space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kernel window**: For each point, place a kernel (like a circle or Gaussian) around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute mean**: Calculate the weighted mean of the points inside the kernel window, weighted by the kernel function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Shift point**: Move the point toward this mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2–4 until points converge (move very little).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cluster formation**: Points that converge to the same mode form a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine dropping balls on a bumpy surface:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each ball rolls uphill to the nearest hilltop (mode).\n",
    "* Balls that end up on the same hilltop belong to the same group.\n",
